# 🪐 Welcome to my little museum of code  

This is not about followers, likes, or trends.  
It’s about quiet nights, dual screens glowing, and the comfort of isolation.  
Here I collect my small artifacts — pieces of code, fragments of thought,  
each repository a room in this silent museum.

### ✨ A Few Words
I believe code can be more than instructions — it can be a quiet art.  
This space is not built for noise, but for focus and subtle details.  
Every project here is a trace of thought, a step in an endless journey.
